Here are the key insights from the Uber Trip Analysis dashboard:

🚖 Overall Performance

104K total bookings generated a $2M total booking value.

Average booking amount is about $14.98.

Average trip distance: 3.36 miles.

Average trip time: 16 minutes.

🌍 Trips by City

Manhattan dominates with ~59.8K passengers, making up the majority of trips.

Brooklyn (18.6K) and Queens (16.9K) are secondary markets.

Bronx (5.6K) and other areas have much smaller shares.

🚘 Vehicle Usage

UberX leads with 39K passengers, making it the most popular vehicle type.

Uber Comfort, Uber Black, and UberXL are evenly used (~17K each).

Uber Green has the lowest adoption (14K).

💳 Payment Methods

Uber Pay is the dominant payment option with 70K+ passengers (67%).

Cash payments are still significant (33K trips).

Amazon Pay and Google Pay are negligible.

📊 Financial & Distance Trends

Uber Green generates the highest total booking value (~$0.6M) with high trip distances.

UberX also shows a high trip volume but lower booking value per trip, indicating shorter/cheaper rides.

Uber Comfort & Uber Black show moderate contributions in both value and distance.

💸 Fee Surge

UberX surge fees (~77K) are far higher than other categories, suggesting demand-supply imbalance.

Other vehicle types (Uber Comfort, UberXL, Uber Black, Uber Green) have similar, much lower surge fees (~29K–33K each).

🌞 Day vs 🌙 Night Trips

Day trips dominate across all vehicle types, almost double the night trips.

Night trips are still consistent but show lower demand.

✅ Business Takeaways

Focus marketing and service optimization in Manhattan, as it contributes the most trips.

UberX is the core revenue driver but faces high surge fees — better driver allocation could balance demand.

Uber Green has strong revenue potential despite low adoption — incentives could drive usage.

Cash payments are still relevant; however, digital payments (Uber Pay) dominate, signaling a move toward cashless systems.

Encourage nighttime demand through discounts or incentives since trips are heavily skewed toward daytime.
